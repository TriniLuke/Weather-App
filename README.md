# Weather-App

Odin Project Weather App

Technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, JS, SASS, WEBPACK.
Webpack was used to bundle and ESLint for linting

This project was very a nice to build the game using modules. I tried to build a scalable project using Factory Functions and Classes. I learned how to use APIs to build really cool projects. This project was really fun and I am happy and excited to have learned about these concepts.
